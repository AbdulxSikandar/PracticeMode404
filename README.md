## 📌 About This Repository

This is my **daily practice & notes space** for Java programming.  
I'm building strong fundamentals step-by-step — from basics to OOP, collections, and problem-solving.

Goal: Turn theory into muscle memory through consistent coding + clear notes.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

| Folder / File          | Description                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Arrays.md`            | Notes + examples specifically about Arrays       |
| `ProblemQuestion/`     | Practice problems, solutions & approaches        |
| `README.md`            | This file — overview & quick navigation          |
| `image.png`            | (Probably) diagrams or screenshots used in notes |

More topic-wise markdown files will be added over time (OOP, Collections, Exceptions, Multithreading, etc.).

## 📖 Core Java Notes (Summary)

Currently covered topics:

- Java History & Features
- JDK vs JRE vs JVM
- Data Types, Variables, Type Casting, Autoboxing
- Control Statements (if, switch, loops)
- Jump Statements (break, continue, return)
- `final`, `this`, `static` keywords
- Classes, Objects, Constructors, Methods
- Access Modifiers, Overloading, Overriding
- `Map` interface (HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap)
- Git commands cheat-sheet

More coming soon: Inheritance deep-dive, Interfaces vs Abstract classes, Exception handling, etc.

## 🚀 How I Use This Repo

1. Read theory from `.md` files
2. Write small demo programs in IDE
3. Solve problems → save in `ProblemQuestion/`
4. Update notes with new learnings / mistakes / better explanations

Feel free to fork / star ⭐ if you're also learning Java!

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Language**: Java (OpenJDK / Oracle JDK)
- **IDE**: [IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code + Extension]
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

## 📅 Progress & Next Goals (2026)

- [ ] Finish Collections Framework notes
- [ ] Add 50+ solved problems in `ProblemQuestion/`
- [ ] Multithreading & Concurrency section
- [ ] Basic DSA implementations (ArrayList from scratch, Stack, Queue…)
- [ ] Start small projects (Console apps → maybe Swing/JavaFX later)
